Here are some key benefits:</p><ol><li><p><strong class=\"kb-bold\">Stronger protection for your accounts: </strong><br>Even if someone gets your password, they won’t be able to access your account without the second code from your <strong class=\"kb-bold\">Authenticator App</strong>. This makes it much harder for hackers to break into your accounts.</p></li><li><p><strong class=\"kb-bold\">Protects against stolen passwords: </strong><br>Passwords can be stolen in many ways, like through phishing attacks or data breaches. 2FA ensures that even if someone knows your password, they still can’t log in without the extra code.</p></li><li><p><strong class=\"kb-bold\">No need for a network connection: </strong><br>Unlike text messages or emails, which rely on a network connection to receive codes, your <strong class=\"kb-bold\">Authenticator App</strong> generates codes directly on your device. This means you don’t have to worry about delays or interference.</p></li><li><p><strong class=\"kb-bold\">Helps secure sensitive data: </strong><br>2FA adds an important layer of security for sensitive accounts, like online banking, email, or social media accounts, ensuring your personal and financial information stays safe.</p></li><li><p><strong class=\"kb-bold\">Peace of mind: </strong><br>Knowing that your accounts are more secure gives you peace of mind, whether you’re online shopping, managing your finances, or connecting with friends.</p></li></ol><p>ℹ️ Remember, 2FA is a great security measure, but it’s still important to be cautious about where you log in. Always make sure you’re accessing your accounts through official websites or apps to avoid phishing attempts and other scams.</p><p>By enabling 2FA, you’re making sure that your accounts are as safe as possible from unauthorized access.<br><br></p><p><strong class=\"kb-bold\">Related Articles</strong><br>→ <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" class=\"kb-link kb-link\" href=\"/en/articles/3904706\">What is an Authenticator App?</a><br>→ <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" class=\"kb-link kb-link\" href=\"/en/articles/4297538\">What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?</a><br>→ <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" class=\"kb-link kb-link\" href=\"/en/articles/4297602\">How to set up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for my online accounts?</a></p><p></p>","created_at":1745407362.47,"id":"kba_2k43m","keywords":["authenticator"],"locale":"en","name":"What are the benefits of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?","slug":"/articles/4297666","status":"published","updated_at":1745594596.308}
