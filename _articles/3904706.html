<p>An <strong class="kb-bold">Authenticator App</strong> helps add an extra layer of security to your online accounts by enabling <strong class="kb-bold">Two-Factor Authentication</strong> (2FA).</p><div class="kb-video-embed"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n5ocvK-q8gc" allow="fullscreen;"></iframe></div><p><strong class="kb-bold">How does it work?</strong><br>When you set up 2FA on an account, the website or service will generate a secret key. This key is usually shared as a QR code or a string of characters. You scan or enter this key into the authenticator app, which saves it and uses it to generate time-based codes. Only the app with the saved secret key can create valid authentication codes.</p><p>It’s similar to receiving codes by email or text messages, but instead of waiting for them to arrive, the app generates the codes on your device. This also means there’s no need for a network connection, and it prevents outside interference. Even if someone knows your password, they still won’t be able to log in to your account without the unique code generated by your Authenticator App.</p><p>ℹ️<strong class="kb-bold"> Note:</strong> Once you’ve added your accounts (like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, or crypto wallets) to the app, it will start generating the 2FA codes you’ll need when signing in, along with your username and password.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong class="kb-bold">Related Articles</strong><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4297538">What is two-factor authentication (2FA)?</a><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4297602">How do I set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for my online accounts?</a><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4297666">What are the benefits of two-factor authentication (2FA)?</a></p>
