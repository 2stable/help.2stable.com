<p><strong class="kb-bold">Two-Factor Authentication</strong> (2FA), also called <em>Two-Step Verification (2SV)</em> or <em>Two-Step Authentication (2SA)</em>, is a security feature that helps protect your online accounts by adding an extra step when you sign in.</p><p>Instead of just using your username and password, 2FA asks for a second piece of information to make sure it’s really you accessing the account. This second step is usually a <strong class="kb-bold">temporary and time-based</strong> <strong class="kb-bold">code</strong> from an <strong class="kb-bold">Authenticator App</strong>, a text message, or an email.</p><p>Using an <strong class="kb-bold">Authenticator App</strong> like ours has some key benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You don’t have to rely on your phone number or email to receive codes.</p></li><li><p>The codes are generated directly on your device; no internet connection needed!</p></li><li><p>It helps protect you from delays or hackers trying to intercept messages and emails.</p></li></ul><p>Even if someone gets your password, they still can’t access your online accounts without the unique code generated on your <strong class="kb-bold">Authenticator App</strong>, and only you have that!</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong class="kb-bold">Related Articles</strong><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/3904706">What is an authenticator app?</a><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4297602">How do I set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for my online accounts?</a><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4297666">What are the benefits of two-factor authentication (2FA)?</a></p>
