<p>If your passwords and saved data aren’t syncing across your devices, here are a few things to check:</p><ol><li><p><strong class="kb-bold">Check your iCloud settings.</strong><br>Make sure you’re signed in with the same <strong class="kb-bold">iCloud</strong> on all devices and that the <strong class="kb-bold">Password Manager</strong> has access to <strong class="kb-bold">iCloud Drive</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong class="kb-bold">Make sure you’re connected to the internet.</strong><br>While the app doesn’t need internet, the <strong class="kb-bold">Sync &amp; Backup</strong> feature requires a connection to upload and restore your data.</p></li><li><p><strong class="kb-bold">You might be using different vaults on each device.</strong><br>To keep everything in sync, all devices need to use the same vault. → See how to check and fix this <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4349762">here</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong class="kb-bold">Double-check your vault password.</strong><br>If you&apos;re restoring a vault but can’t unlock it, make sure you’re entering the correct password.</p></li></ol><p>ℹ️ You have unlimited tries to enter your password. Feel free to give it a few attempts until you get it right. Double-check for any typos, as this can often be the cause of issues.</p><p>🔐 <strong class="kb-bold">Note: </strong>For your security, the app always asks for your password first, even if you usually use Face or Touch ID. This helps confirm you’re the rightful owner before syncing or restoring data.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong class="kb-bold">Related Articles</strong><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4349570">How does the Sync &amp; Backup feature work in the Password Manager?</a><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4349826">How do I restore or sync my vault on a new device?</a><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4348994">How do I move my saved passwords and data into one primary vault?</a></p>
