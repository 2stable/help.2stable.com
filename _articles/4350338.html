This second step is usually a <strong class="kb-bold">temporary and time-based</strong> <strong class="kb-bold">code</strong> from an app like our <strong class="kb-bold">Password Manager</strong>,<strong class="kb-bold"> </strong>which can generate the codes, or users can receive them through a text message or an email sent by the online platform.</p><p>Using a <strong class="kb-bold">Password Manager</strong> like ours has some key benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You don’t have to rely on your phone number or email to receive codes.</p></li><li><p>The codes are generated directly on your device; no internet connection needed!</p></li><li><p>It helps protect you from delays or hackers trying to intercept messages and emails.</p></li></ul><p>Once set up, even if someone gets your password, they still can’t access your online accounts without the unique code generated on your <strong class="kb-bold">Password Manager</strong>, and only you have that!</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong class="kb-bold">Related Articles</strong><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4349634">What is a Password Manager app?</a><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4348866">How do I set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for my online accounts with the Password Manager?</a><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4349506">What are the benefits of using our Password Manager?</a></p>
