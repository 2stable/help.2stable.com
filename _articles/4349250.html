<p>If you want to update your password, you can do so directly from the <strong class="kb-bold">Password Manager </strong>app, as long as you still have access to a device where the app is unlocked (with your current password, Face ID, or Touch ID).</p><p>Here’s how to change it:</p><ol><li><p>Open the <strong class="kb-bold">Password Manager</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong class="kb-bold">Settings</strong> &gt; <strong class="kb-bold">Security</strong> and unlock to access. (This section is protected and requires Face ID or Touch ID, or your current password to enter.)</p></li><li><p>Once verified, select <strong class="kb-bold">Change password</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Enter and confirm your new password.</p></li><li><p>Finally, tap <strong class="kb-bold">Change</strong> to save your new password.</p></li></ol><p>ℹ️ You can choose any password; there are no specific rules for length or characters. Just pick something memorable and secure.</p><p>❗<strong class="kb-bold">Don’t forget: </strong>Your new password will be needed to restore your vault or if Face ID or Touch ID ever fails. All your data is end-to-end encrypted, which means that we don&apos;t have access to the user&apos;s data or password and won&apos;t be able to restore your access. Be sure to keep it safe!</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong class="kb-bold">Related Articles</strong><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4349122">Forgot your password?</a><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4349826">How do I restore or sync my vault on a new device?</a><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4349378">How do I switch between vaults in the Password Manager?</a></p>
