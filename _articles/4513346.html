<p>A <strong class="kb-bold">Passkeys App</strong> helps you sign in to websites and apps more securely, without needing to remember or type a password. It stores and manages your passkeys, which are a safer, easier alternative to passwords.</p><p><strong class="kb-bold">How does it work?</strong><br>When you create a passkey for an account, a <strong class="kb-bold">unique digital key</strong> is saved on your device. This passkey is made up of two parts:</p><ul><li><p>A <strong class="kb-bold">public key</strong>, which is shared with the website or app.</p></li><li><p>A <strong class="kb-bold">private key</strong>, which stays securely on your device and never gets shared.</p></li></ul><p>When you sign in, your device uses the <strong class="kb-bold">private key</strong> to prove it’s you, often by asking for <strong class="kb-bold">Face ID</strong>, <strong class="kb-bold">Touch ID</strong>, or your <strong class="kb-bold">Passkeys App password</strong>. The app handles all of this in the background, so you don’t have to worry about entering your online account password.</p><p>The <strong class="kb-bold">Passkeys App</strong> also makes things easier by syncing your passkeys across devices using your iCloud account. That means you only need to set a passkey once, and by syncing the app across devices, you can then use it to log in from your phone, tablet, or computer.</p><p>ℹ️ <strong class="kb-bold">Note:</strong> Once you’ve created a passkey for an account (like Google, Amazon, or other supported services), your <strong class="kb-bold">Passkeys App</strong> will let you sign in with a quick face scan, fingerprint, or password, without typing anything. </p><p></p><p></p><p><strong class="kb-bold">Related Articles</strong><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4513410">What is a passkey?</a><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4513730">What are the benefits of using our Passkeys App?</a><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4509890">How does the Sync &amp; Backup feature work in the Passkeys App?</a></p>
