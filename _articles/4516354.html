<p>A passkey is a new logging method, a secure way to sign in to your online accounts, without needing a password.</p><p>Instead of typing a password, a passkey uses your <strong class="kb-bold">device’s built-in</strong> <strong class="kb-bold">verification</strong> methods, like <strong class="kb-bold">Face ID</strong>, <strong class="kb-bold">Touch ID</strong>, or your <strong class="kb-bold">Password Manager password</strong>, to prove it’s you. It works in the background using two linked parts:</p><ul><li><p>A <strong class="kb-bold">public key</strong> that’s saved by the website or service.</p></li><li><p>A <strong class="kb-bold">private key</strong> that stays safely on your device and is never shared.</p></li></ul><p>When you log in, your device verifies that you’re the right person and confirms to the app or website that you have the private key saved on the device being used, without revealing or sending the key itself.</p><p>Using a passkey has some major benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You don’t have to remember or type passwords anymore.</p></li><li><p>Your <strong class="kb-bold">private key</strong> never leaves your device, keeping your info more secure.</p></li><li><p>You’re protected from phishing and fake websites trying to steal your login.</p></li></ul><p>Even if someone tries to hack your account, they can’t log in without your device and your face or fingerprint to unlock the passkey.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong class="kb-bold">Related Articles</strong><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4381826">How do I set up a passkey with the Password Manager?</a><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4350018">How do I add and customize a Login in the Password Manager?</a><br>→ <a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="kb-link kb-link" href="/en/articles/4350274">How do I create and organize Groups in the Password Manager?</a></p>
